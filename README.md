This mod allows Argonian players and NPCs to innately breathe underwater, swim faster, and rest underwater. Optionally, these benefits can also be given to vampires as well as all races.

This MWSE mod allows Argonian players and NPCs to more effectively showcase their superiority in the water. Made for the 2023 May Modathon.


## Features:

Argonian players and NPCs are now able to innately swim faster and breathe underwater without the need to cast a Water Breathing spell. Eligible NPCs are dynamically given these abilities as they are encountered while changing cells. The level of Swift Swim given can be customized or disabled. In addition, Argonian players are now able to rest underwater as they would on land. However, this doesn't stop them from being ambushed!

These changes only apply to Argonians, but can also be set to be given to all races if desired. Vampires can now breathe underwater and rest underwater by default as well.

Also, Argonians won't be able to breathe water during a certain Temple quest...
